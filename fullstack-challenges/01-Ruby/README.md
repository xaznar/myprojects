The Ruby module has 6 days. The first 4 days deal with core notions you absolutely need to understand.

### `01 Programming Basics`

Play with IRB, launch a ruby script from the terminal. Learn about variables, methods and built-in objects.

### `02 Flow, Conditionals & Arrays`

Learn about conditional statements and loops; coding structures that modify the flow of your programs. Define and play with arrays.

### `03 Iterators & Blocks`

Embrace all the cool ruby iterators (`each`, `select`, `map` and more). Understand what's a ruby block and how a method can call a block with `yield`.

### `04 Hash & Symbols`

Finally, let's introduce hashes - data stuctures designed to store key-value pairs like dictionaries. Define and manipulate your own hashes. Understand symbols - objects a bit similar to strings but more adpated for storing "keywords" of your code. You'll often see symbols as hash keys, so get used to it!

#### Friday ruby quiz

On Friday afternoon, at 2pm there will be a short quiz (30mins). No computer, no Google, just pencil and paper. It's not high school and you won't be graded ðŸ˜Š But it's very useful to understand what you got wrong, and identify your weakpoints. So take your time and try to answer as precisely as you can.

When the quiz is finished, teachers will take you one-by-one during 15-min reviews to go through your answers and try to re-explain things. This chat will help you know what to go over during the weekend and whether or not you should join the Reboot group next Monday-Tuesday (see next section).

## Advanced part

The two last days of the Ruby module deal with more advanced stuff. These days are not mandatory. Every student should at least listen to the morning talk. But after that, the class should split between:

- A "Reboot" group who will rehearse core notions on new challenges (ex: variables/methods/arrays/hashes/iterators).
- An Advanced group who will keep on working on kitt challenges about regexp and parsing.

If you're not 100% confident on the core notions, join the Reboot group! No shame about it, the Reboot is a buffer to rehearse what really matters for the rest of the bootcamp.

### `05 Regular Expressions`

Play with these new objects representing "string patterns".

### `06 Parsing`

Learn to read/write in standard data-files such as CSV and JSON, and play with your first API.
