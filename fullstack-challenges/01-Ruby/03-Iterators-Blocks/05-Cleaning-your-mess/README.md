## Background & Objectives

Before you start with your code, spend some time:

- Asking yourself what the **objective** is
- Simplifying the initial problem as much as you can. **Start small - Achieve big**

If you skip these steps, you'll often end up with redundant / poor code because you started without really knowing where you were going...

Here is a ruby function to animate your gym training. Running this program will get the following result:

```
hop! One more time...
hop! hop! One more time...
hop! hop! hop! One more time...
hop! hop! hop! hop! One more time...
hop! hop! hop! hop! hop! One more time...
hop! hop! hop! hop! hop! hop! One more time...
```

The problem is that this code was written by a poor developer, who started coding without thinking... so there are a lot of useless parts

## Specs

Try to refactor the code in `lib/refactor_gym.rb`, getting rid of useless code.
