## Background & Objectives

Before we move on to looking the Mister Cocktail challenge let's review some of the principles we saw yesterday when we looked at advanced routing.

## Specs

Look at the `lib/quiz.rb` file. You will find a quiz with a few methods
to test your rails knowledge so far. Make sure each of the methods returns
the correct information to pass the quiz!
⚠️ Try and answer them before running `rake`.

### Question 1

Return an `Array` of 7 `String`s corresponding to the 7 CRUD routes generated by `resources :restaurants`.
Hint: a route follows this pattern: `verb "url", to: "controller#action"`
/!\ in Rails' context, a route is not a String!

### Question 2

Return a `true` or `false` to answer this question:
If you have a one to many relationship between your models like `Restaurant` and `Review` (belongs_to :restaurant), do you always have to nest all your routes for `Review` in `Restaurant`?

### Question 3

Return a `String` of the ActiveRecord validation need to make sure no record is created without a `name`.


## Key learning points

- Understand what `resources` does in your routes.
- Understand many to many and nested routes.
- How to add validations to our model to avoid DB problems.
