## Projects

We are now entering the last module of the program. It's your time to shine. Time is going to really fly, so make sure you are deploying in production as often as you can, and **don't neglect your front-end**! Remember, the look of your site will be the first thing people see on Demo Day.

Good luck - you're going to be amazing. Here are your milestones:

- Intermediate demo: first demo in front of the class to get staff feedback and organize your roadmap for the second half of the module.
- Dress rehearsal: rehearsal for final demo with the staff only, the day before Demoday. Be prepared!
- Demoday: THE BIG DAY. Everyone is here! Press, VCs, your family! Smash it!
