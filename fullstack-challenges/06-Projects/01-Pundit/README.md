## Projects - Day One

You should now belong to a team of 3 to 4 people, with a clear concept for the MVP you're going
to be building for the next 2 weeks. The goal of the day is the same as Airbnb - Day 1.

For **each step**, ask a teacher to validate it. Rushing straight into the code is the best way to waste time writing code that you won't use!

#### User stories
Duplicate this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_q-wwWiWUY5VL0gZVtqWIidWEtfwhX8FHEbwaW0LuFI/edit?usp=sharing) (1 per team) and invite your teammates to collaborate.

Write your **user stories** down. You should have no more than 15. Group them by user journey.

#### Database
Open [Kitt's DB schema builder](https://kitt.lewagon.com/db) and figure out the **database schema** needed for your user stories

#### Mockup & Routes
Open your figma from the Product Design Sprint and make sure it still matches the demo you have in mind for Demoday! If it doesn't, take some time to think about it as a team, and rework your wireframe.

From there, figure out the **routes** and add them to your spreadsheet, along with the corresponding **controller** and **action**.

#### Rails New
When starting your rails app, you **must** use one of the [**Wagon Rails Templates**](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates/tree/master). Make sure you use the [Devise template](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates/tree/master#devise) if you need a `User` model!
