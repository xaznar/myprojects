## Background & Objectives

The goal of the day is to implement each one of the `CRUD` operations and build a copycat of
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).

**Note**: in this exercise, we **give** you the `DB` global variable, so
no need to instantiate a new `SQLite3::Database` yourself. Just use `DB.execute` in
your code, it'll work (have a look at `spec/models/post_spec.rb` to view how
the `DB` variable is created).

## Tests
We prepared for you a `test.rb` file where the `DB` global variable is created the same way
as in `spec/models/post_spec.rb`. Feel free to use this file to test your methods.

## Specs

In this first exercise, we focus on **R**ead (the `R` in `CRUD`).
Implement a class that will handle a `posts` table, defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `posts` (
  `id`  INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  `title` TEXT,
  `url` TEXT,
  `votes`  INTEGER
);
```

### `initialize`

Add the `initialize` method to store the above columns in instance variables. Add relevant readers & accessors.

### `find`

Implement a **class** method `find(id)` on the `Post` class that takes
an integer as an argument (the post id) and returns an instance
of `Post`.

(Assume there is a global variable `DB` defined in the program, no need for
you to instantiate it)

We want you to protect the `find` method against **SQL injections**. What is an SQL injection you may ask? Well, if you [hack this bank](https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/sql-injection#/start), you'll get the picture!.
Here's a hint on the exercise: You might need to pass several arguments to the `.execute` method using [placeholders](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/sql/#placeholders-sqlite-gem).

### `all`

Implement a **class** method `all` on the `Post` class which takes
no argument and will return an array containing every `Post` instance.

## Further suggestions

An SQL injection is a type of attack where the person using your application won't just pass a regular integer `id`
to the `find` method, but will add an evil string to damage your data. If you look at the SQL query in the spec, you'll see what we mean.
