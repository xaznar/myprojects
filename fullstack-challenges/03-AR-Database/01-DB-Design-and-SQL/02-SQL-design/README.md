## Background & Objectives

The goal of this first challenge is to become familiar with database design,
*a* crucial skill to make your backend maintainable, flexible and efficient.

## Specs

#### Survey database design

There are many ways to build a survey database, but let's start by building a basic
system with users, questions, responses and votes.

Here are the requirements of our system:

- The application manages several `users`
- A user can create many `surveys`, but a survey is created by only one user
- A survey has several `questions`.
- A question has several possible `answers`.
- When a user answers a survey, they can only choose one answer. These are stored as `user_answers`.

#### Design the schema

Design a database schema for a survey app that meets the requirements.
For this, you must use the [SQL Designer](http://db.lewagon.com).
To check your solution, click on "Save / Load", then "Save XML", copy/paste the generated XML code
in `lib/survey.xml`. You can then `rake` to check your solution.
