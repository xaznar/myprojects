The DB & ActiveRecord module has 4 days.

## `01 Schema Design & SQL`

Time to learn about relational databases, discover the different relationships between tables (`1:n`, `n:n`) and how to **draw** a database scheme. Then, we'll get started on SQL - the language used to make queries to our database structured with keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN` etc.). We will start with simple "read queries" (`SELECT`) on day one.

## `02 CRUD with SQL`

Second day of SQL. First, we get to grips with CRUD. After that, you'll learn to write in the DB using a few new SQL keywords (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

## `03 Active Record Basics`

This is the first part of Active Record - a powerful ruby library to connect your object to a database. Active Record is one of the core modules in Rails. Discover how an ActiveRecord model is magically linked to a table thanks to a simple **naming convention**. That's Active Record magic!

## `04 Associations & Validations`

Time to go deeper into Active Record and learn about validations and associations.

## Quiz

At 2pm, it's your second paper quiz of the program!

This one will take you up to 45 minutes, and the answers will be reviewed by the lead-teacher in live-code (for all the class at the same time and not in one-to-one reviews). Only one more quiz after this!
